# Reviewing Interests

To review interets, navigate to the Interets Portal through the navbar. On this page, admin can choose the listing type they want to review interests for by selecting either the "Cases", "Limited Case Assignments", or "Language Support" tabs. 

The interest portal features 3 main components:
- A horizontal scrollview that displays all case, limited case assignment, or language support listings.
- A table with interests corresponding to the listing selected from the scrollview.
- A container where the applicants contact information and response to the interest form is displayed.

Clicking on a listing from the horizontal scroll view will filter the table to display only the interests submitted for that listing. To view the details of a user's application and their information, admins can click on the desired listing in the table.
