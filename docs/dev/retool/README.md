# Retool

[Retool](https://retool.com/) is the 3rd party service that we're using to build the admin dashboard for IJP.
We use it to empower IJP admins with the ability to manage listings and interest applications on the website.

If you are a developer, you may want to check in with your team to gain access to the IJP project on Retool before beginning modifications.
